## the Linux File System

The first thing thats important to understand when dealing with a linux system is the root directory. It is located at "/",
if you happen to be on a linux system and you type in cd / you will change your directory to the root directory.

```bash:terminal
[draxel/laptop][~] $ cd /
[draxel/laptop][/] $
```

In addition another useful thing to know with linux systems is the the "~" represents the current users home director.
For example im currently logged in as draxel, which means if i type cd ~ i will change directory to /home/draxel

```bash:terminal
[draxel/laptop][â€¦/website] $ cd ~
[draxel/laptop][~] $
```
