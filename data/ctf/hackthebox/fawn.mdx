## Summary

This one was interesting because I had actually never done anything with FTP previously. So this one was nice in the sense that I got to learn something new. Ultimately learning is the goal of this endeavor so I think we can safely say we are on the right track. The images used in this post were taken from the HackTheBox writeup on fawn since they are high quality. [^1]

## Flag

```bash
035db21c881520061c53e0536e44f815
```

## Detailed solution

If you've been following along then you'll have your .opvn file (for openvpn) so that you can ssh into the machine. If you don't want to use your local machine you can always use HackTheBox's browser based machine.

- If you haven't been following along you can checkout the previous post [HackTheBox - Meow](https://www.draxel.io/blog/ctf-hackthebox-meow)
- you can also check out [HackTheBox Access Guide](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/articles/5185687-gs-introduction-to-lab-access)

**Now that your hopefully connected to the machines we can get going.**

1. First things first lets run nmap

```bash
sudo nmap TARGET_IP # replace TARGET_IP with the ip address of your target machine
```

2. run nmap with the -sV flags

```bash
sudo nmap -sV TARGET_IP # replace TARGET_IP with the ip address of your target machine
```

3. try to connect

```bash
ftp TARGET_IP # replace TARGET_IP with the ip address of your target machine
```

![ftp-connect.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/draxel/image/upload/v1638003587/ctf/hackthebox/fawn/ftp-connect.png)

4. at this point we get prompted to provide a username and password. But after checking out the documentation on HackTheBox and some google foo I learned that when misconfigured a FTP service allows for anonymous accounts to access the service.

5. This should get you in and provide you with a new prompt if you then run ls you'll see the flag.txt

6. finally lets get the flag onto our machine so we can read it.

![flag.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/draxel/image/upload/v1638003588/ctf/hackthebox/fawn/flag.png)

7. finally on our local machine we just cat the flag.txt

```bash
cat flag.txt # make sure your in the directory in which you the flag.txt got downloaded to.
```
