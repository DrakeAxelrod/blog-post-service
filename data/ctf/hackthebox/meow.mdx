## Summary

Simple enough, which makes sense since the aim of the challenge is to introduce you to the HackTheBox platform.
The hardest part was actually answering the questions in the correct format.
I'm sure though that it will get more exciting as we progress. The images used in this post were taken from the HackTheBox writeup on fawn since they are high quality. [^1]
